## 📌 Project Overview
AquaDox is an **automatic aerator system** designed to enhance oxygen levels in aquaculture environments. It helps maintain optimal water conditions by automating aeration based on real-time oxygen levels, ensuring healthier aquatic life and efficient resource utilization.

## ✨ Features
- 📡 **Real-time Monitoring** – Continuously tracks dissolved oxygen levels.
- ⚡ **Automated Aeration** – Activates/deactivates aerators based on threshold values.
- 📱 **Remote Access** – Control & monitor via a mobile app/web dashboard.
- 🌞 **Energy Efficient** – Optimized operation reduces power consumption.
- 🔔 **Alerts & Notifications** – Notifies users of critical oxygen level changes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Sensors (Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature), Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)
- **Software**: Python/C++, IoT Cloud Integration, Web & Mobile Dashboard

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Hardware Setup
1. Connect the dissolved oxygen sensor to the microcontroller.
2. Integrate the relay module for aerator control.
3. Power up the system and ensure sensor calibration.

### 2️⃣ Software Installation
